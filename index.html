        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          If you want to get to know me, then I suppose we can start with my name being William, but you can call me
          any
          nickname derivative of it you'd like. People that have known me for a long time usually call me Will because
          that
          was what I preferred growing up. Nowadays, I don't mind if you call me William, Willy, Bill, or Billy! I am
          32
          years young from College Station, Texas, and have always been fascinated with technology since I was
          a pre-teen.
        </p>

        <p>
          Back in the Windows 95 and DOS days, my mother got our family's first desktop computer. Since the point
          forward I
          was always the one the family would come to when they needed help with anything having to do with computers.
          Ironically, booting into DOS in order to play Dr. Quandry's Island and Word Munchers was not child's play!
          When I
          was 14 years old my dad took me into a Half-Price Bookstore and let me pick out any book I wanted. After
          putting
          on the best "pleading eye face" that every parent can almost never say no to, my dad reluctantly allowed me
          to
          take home "Steal This Computer Book" which is essentially a beginner's guide to becoming a "cypherpunk".
        </p>
        <p>
          By the time I was 18 years old I had a CompTIA A+ Certification, a year of Java programming, and a year of
          C++ programming under my belt due to the great programs at A&M Consolidated High School. I was
          seemingly destined
          to work with computers, but it turned out that life had a different plan for me. With the help of my dad, I
          landed
          a great job that I could not refuse in the oil & gas industry which ultimately steered me away from
          pursuing a
          career in technology. After many diverse work experiences in numerous industries, I have ended up gravitating
          back
          to my main interests by deciding to pursue a career involving the things I've always bee most passionate
          about in
          life- technology and Computer Science.

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <p>
          Several years ago I got interested in getting back into programming, so I spent about a year and a half
          learning
          on my own with online tutorials and videos (when I wasn't working at my other full-time job.) Since June of
          2018,
          I have been self-employed and spent all of my time as a software engineer. My primary focus has been on
          building responsive and reactive full-stack applications. The tools that I am most familiar with include
          HTML,
          CSS, Sass, Bootstrap, Javascript, Node, Meteor, MongoDB, Vue, GraphQL.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have so far served several clients as a freelance web developer by creating responsive and reactive
          full-stack
          applications which enable them to make their businesses more efficient. My biggest project to date was
          helping an
          oil & gas services company which needed an automated system to organize the workflow and data involving
          researching the ownership and status of the assets owned by a large ranch in west Texas.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am also the Managing Director of YOLO International LLC which is an investment company focused on
          Bitcoin, decentralized technologies, and precious metals. I have served as the lead Software
          Engineer of multiple full-stack web applications in our portfolio. Our portfolio currently consists of
          Bitcoin,
          Cryptocurrencies, Gold, Silver, Domain Names, and Website Assets.

              Cryptohun.ch is a tradable card game where players have complete control and ownership of their digital
              in-game assets by leveraging blockchain assets. By utilizing a public ledger for card ownership, players
              are able to audit how many of each card exists for an optimal card economy. The game is open source, so
              the
              game's
              players ultimately decide the game's direction, rules, policies, and graphics by choosing which game
