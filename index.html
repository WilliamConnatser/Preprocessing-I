        <p>
          If you want to get to know me, then I suppose we can start with my name being William, but you can call me
          any
          nickname derivative of it you'd like. People that have known me for a long time usually call me Will because
          that
          was what I preferred growing up. Nowadays, I don't mind if you call me William, Willy, Bill, or Billy! I am
          32
          years young from College Station, Texas, and have always been fascinated with technology since I was
          a pre-teen.

          Back in the Windows 95 and DOS days, my mother got our family's first desktop computer. Since the point
          forward I
          was always the one the family would come to when they needed help with anything having to do with computers.
          Ironically, booting into DOS in order to play Dr. Quandry's Island and Word Munchers was not child's play!
          When I
          was 14 years old my dad took me into a Half-Price Bookstore and let me pick out any book I wanted. After
          putting
          on the best "pleading eye face" that every parent can almost never say no to, my dad reluctantly allowed me
          to
          take home "Steal This Computer Book" which is essentially a beginner's guide to becoming a "cypherpunk".

          By the time I was 18 years old I had a CompTIA A+ Certification, a year of Java programming, and a year of
          C++ programming under my belt due to the great programs at A&M Consolidated High School. I was
          seemingly destined
          to work with computers, but it turned out that life had a different plan for me. With the help of my dad, I
          landed
          a great job that I could not refuse in the oil & gas industry which ultimately steered me away from
          pursuing a
          career in technology. After many diverse work experiences in numerous industries, I have ended up gravitating
          back
          to my main interests by deciding to pursue a career involving the things I've always bee most passionate
          about in
          life- technology and Computer Science.
