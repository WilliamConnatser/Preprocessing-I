                <p>
                    Several years ago I got interested in getting back into programming, so I spent about a year and a
                    half
                    learning
                    on my own with online tutorials and videos (when I wasn't working at my other full-time job.) Since
                    June of
                    2018,
                    I have been self-employed and spent all of my time as a software engineer. My primary focus has
                    been on
                    building responsive and reactive full-stack applications. The tools that I am most familiar with
                    include
                    HTML,
                    CSS, Sass, Bootstrap, Javascript, Node, Meteor, MongoDB, Vue, GraphQL.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have so far served several clients as a freelance web developer by creating responsive and
                    reactive
                    full-stack
                    applications which enable them to make their businesses more efficient. My biggest project to date
                    was
                    helping an
                    oil & gas services company which needed an automated system to organize the workflow and data
                    involving
                    researching the ownership and status of the assets owned by a large ranch in west Texas.
                </p>

                    I am also the Managing Director of YOLO International LLC which is an investment company focused on
                    Bitcoin, decentralized technologies, and precious metals. I have served as the lead Software
                    Engineer of multiple full-stack web applications in our portfolio. Our portfolio currently consists
                    of
                    Bitcoin,
                    Cryptocurrencies, Gold, Silver, Domain Names, and Website Assets.
